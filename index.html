					<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
					<p>(Below there are some stories when I learned CS, feel free to skip this part if not interested......)</p>
					<p>To talk about my starting point of learning computer science, I need to mention my uncle. He was a software developer majoring in big data. He achieves his reputation among all my relatives because of the national-wide commercial software he has implemented. His career impressed me. It was from that time I made up my mind to pursue the mysterious computer world and to become an expert in the future. Additionally, My family encourages me to follow my interest. With this background, I chose to study computer science.</p>
					<p>In my undergraduate multimedia course, I learned how to use Photoshop, 3DSmax, Premiere. I was the team leader that time. We wonder how to make most attractive multimedia video, so we followed some outstanding designer and video master on a Chinese version twitter (it is called Weibo). My team started from creating basic materials to figure out the best way to present out. We designed the rudimental template and spent a month building it with true interest. The outcome was good. Our team wins ‘A’ in the end of that project. We enjoy creating itself. It also told me that if I want to explore more in computer world, I should prepare to learn more.  </p>
